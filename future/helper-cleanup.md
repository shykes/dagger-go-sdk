# Helper Cleanup Design

This document records the helper boundary for the Go SDK Dang module after the
cleanup. Helpers are narrow wrappers around core API gaps. They are not where Go
SDK policy lives.

## Goals

- Prefer native Dang/core calls whenever they work.
- Use helpers only for module-context bugs or Dang ID rehydration bugs.
- Keep helpers composable: source helpers produce IDs, and the generic query
  helper consumes IDs through raw GraphQL.
- Do not mount the caller workspace into helpers as `/ws`.
- Do not fake `.git` in the caller workspace. The update workaround may create
  a tiny synthetic `.git/HEAD` marker inside `/mock` only to give core a local
  context boundary.
- Do not add operation-specific nested Dagger helpers for generation or
  dependency mutation.

## Bugs Being Worked Around

### Dang Cannot Rehydrate `*ID` Scalars

Dang currently treats GraphQL `*ID` scalar inputs as object handles. For example,
these fail during type inference:

```dang
loadModuleSourceFromID(id: stdout)
loadModuleSourceFromID(id: stdout :: ModuleSourceID!)
loadDirectoryFromID(id: someDirectoryID)
```

The explicit type hint changes the value type, but Dang still expects an object
handle for the `id` argument. This is tracked as `vito/dang#47`.

Raw GraphQL does not have that confusion:

```graphql
loadModuleSourceFromID(id: ModuleSourceID!): ModuleSource!
loadDirectoryFromID(id: DirectoryID!): Directory!
```

So helper-produced IDs are consumed by a nested raw GraphQL helper, not by Dang
typecasts.

### Module-Side Source Loading Loses Caller Context

Two source-loading calls are unreliable from inside this module:

- `moduleSource(...)` cannot reliably access caller workspace files.
- `Directory.asModuleSource(...)` can lose caller context during user-default
  lookup and fail while searching for `.env`.

Until those core/context bugs are fixed, source construction happens in helper
processes that open nested Dagger clients.

### `withDependencies` Rejects Workspace-Backed Directory Sources

Local source helpers now produce workspace-backed directory module sources.
Passing those to `ModuleSource.withDependencies` currently fails with:

```text
unhandled module source kind: DIR_SOURCE
```

The old helper mounted the workspace at `/ws` to force `LOCAL_SOURCE`. That
workaround is intentionally removed. If `DIR_SOURCE` is rejected, that is a core
API bug to fix, not a helper behavior to preserve.

Dependency update is the exception: core's `withUpdateDependencies` still needs
`LOCAL_SOURCE` so it can skip existing local dependencies and update remote
dependencies. The workaround builds a dagger.json-only mock workspace, overlays
the edited module config, adds a synthetic `.git/HEAD`, and runs the update
query against that. It does not copy source files.

### Dang JSON Edits Need Two Workarounds

Dang can cast a literal core `JSON` scalar to a string:

```dang
toString("{}" :: JSON!)
```

`JSONValue.contents` is trickier. Calling `toString` on that result gives a JSON
string literal. To pass the rendered JSON to file APIs, decode the string once:

```dang
let rendered = toString(value.contents(pretty: true))
json().withContents(rendered :: JSON!).asString
```

The other wrinkle is that `dagger.json` dependencies are a legacy union shape:

```json
[
  "../dep",
  {"name": "other", "source": "github.com/acme/other"}
]
```

The core `JSONValue` API can read fields and set fields:

1. `File.asJSON`
2. `JSONValue.field`
3. `JSONValue.withField`
4. `JSONValue.contents`

`JSONValue.asArray` returns a GraphQL object list, so Dang list methods do not
work on it directly. This fails:

```text
json().withContents("[...]" :: JSON!).asArray.map { value => ... }
```

The workaround from <https://github.com/vito/dang/issues/46> does apply: select
a field first, then use list methods. For `JSONValue`, selecting `contents`
gives each array item as raw JSON:

```dang
json()
  .withContents("[...]" :: JSON!)
  .asArray
  .{contents}
  .map { value => toString(value.contents) }
```

That is enough for dependency list/add/remove. Those edits live in Dang and are
built from raw JSON fragments. Dependency update also merges the query response
in Dang. Local dependencies are preserved from the original `dagger.json`; only
remote dependencies returned by core are rewritten.

## Helper Shape

### `helpers/module-source`

CLI:

```sh
WORKSPACE_ID=... module-source REF [--cwd CWD] [--local] [--name NAME]
```

Output: exactly one `ModuleSourceID` on stdout.

Behavior:

1. Load `Workspace` from `WORKSPACE_ID`.
2. Resolve `REF` against `--cwd` or `Workspace.path`.
3. If the resolved path exists in the workspace, compute include patterns from
   `dagger.json` files, declared `include` entries, and local dependencies, then call
   `Workspace.directory(...).asModuleSource(sourceRootPath: ...)`.
4. If the path does not exist and `--local` was set, fail.
5. Otherwise call core `moduleSource(ref, disableFindUp: true)`.
6. Apply `withName` when `--name` is set.
7. Print the source ID.

This helper does not mount the workspace into its container. It reads
`dagger.json` files through the `Workspace` object.

### `helpers/directory-as-module-source`

CLI:

```sh
DIRECTORY_ID=... directory-as-module-source SOURCE_ROOT_PATH [--name NAME]
```

Output: exactly one `ModuleSourceID` on stdout.

Behavior:

1. Load `Directory` from `DIRECTORY_ID`.
2. Call `Directory.asModuleSource(sourceRootPath: SOURCE_ROOT_PATH)`.
3. Apply `withName` when `--name` is set.
4. Print the source ID.

This is used by `init`, where Dang first constructs a seeded directory and then
needs that directory interpreted as a module source.

### `helpers/dagger-query`

CLI:

```sh
DAGGER_QUERY_VARS_JSON=... dagger-query --query /query.graphql --out /response.json
```

Output: `/response.json` plus any files/directories exported by the query.

Behavior:

1. Open a nested Dagger client.
2. Read the checked-in GraphQL query file.
3. Load variables from `DAGGER_QUERY_VARS_JSON`, which is raw JSON text.
4. Execute the raw GraphQL request.
5. Write the full response object to `--out`.

The helper is generic. It does not know about Go SDK generation, dependencies,
or changesets.

## Dang Wrapper

The public constructor is exposed from the module root:

```dang
pub nestedDaggerQuery(name: String!, varsJSON: String!): NestedDaggerQuery!
```

Callers usually build `varsJSON` with Dang's `toJSON(...)` builtin. The wrapper
does not use core `JSONValue` for query variables.

`NestedDaggerQuery` lives in `00-nested-dagger-query.dang`:

```dang
type NestedDaggerQuery {
  """Return the container state before executing the query."""
  pub inputContainer: Container!

  """Return the container state after executing the query."""
  pub outputContainer: Container!

  """Return the engine's GraphQL response to the query."""
  pub response: JSON!

  """Return a string value extracted from the query response at the given path."""
  pub responseString(path: [String!]!): String!

  """
  Return a directory from the container in which the query was executed.

  Use this to retrieve side effects of the query, for example exported files or
  directories.
  """
  pub outputDir(path: String! = ".", include: [String!]! = [], exclude: [String!]! = []): Directory!
}
```

The wrapper deliberately does not return a `Changeset`. The query controls its
own side effects. The call site chooses how to interpret them:

```dang
let q = DaggerQueryHelpers().nestedDaggerQuery(
  "module-source/generated-context-changeset",
  toJSON({{
    source: sourceID,
    root: ".",
    before: "/before",
    after: "/after",
  }}),
)

q.outputDir("/after").changes(q.outputDir("/before"))
```

## Query Files

Checked-in query files are the operation layer:

```text
queries/module-source/generated-context-changeset.graphql
queries/module-source/updated-dependencies.graphql
```

Generation query:

```graphql
query GeneratedContextChangeset(
  $source: ModuleSourceID!
  $root: String!
  $before: String!
  $after: String!
) {
  loadModuleSourceFromID(id: $source) {
    generatedContextChangeset {
      before {
        directory(path: $root) {
          export(path: $before)
        }
      }
      after {
        directory(path: $root) {
          export(path: $after)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Update query:

```graphql
query UpdatedDependencies($source: String!, $updates: [String!]!) {
  moduleSource(refString: $source, disableFindUp: true, requireKind: LOCAL_SOURCE) {
    withUpdateDependencies(dependencies: $updates) {
      dependencies {
        moduleName
        kind
        asString
        pin
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The update query does not call `generatedContextDirectory`. It asks core to
resolve the updated dependency set, then `ModuleConfig` writes remote dependency
updates back into the original `dagger.json`.

## Current Flow

Generation:

1. Build a `ModuleSourceID` with `helpers/module-source`.
2. Run `queries/module-source/generated-context-changeset.graphql` through
   `helpers/dagger-query`.
3. Convert `/after` and `/before` into a changeset in Dang.

Init with generation:

1. Build the seeded directory in Dang.
2. Build a `ModuleSourceID` with `helpers/directory-as-module-source`.
3. Run the generated-context query through `helpers/dagger-query`.
4. Compare `/after` to an empty directory so seeded files and generated files
   are included.

Dependency add:

1. Edit `dagger.json` in Dang through `ModuleConfig`.
2. Return a changeset containing only the edited `dagger.json`.

Dependency remove:

1. Edit `dagger.json` in Dang through `ModuleConfig`.
2. Return a changeset containing only the edited `dagger.json`.

Dependency update:

1. Build a dagger.json-only mock workspace.
2. Overlay the edited module config and add `/mock/.git/HEAD` so core treats
   `/mock` as the local context root.
3. Run the update query against `/mock/<module>` as a `LOCAL_SOURCE`.
4. Merge returned remote dependency metadata into the original `dagger.json`;
   preserve local dependency entries exactly as written.
5. Return a changeset containing only the edited `dagger.json`.

Update-all skips local dependencies, matching core behavior. Updating a named
local dependency still fails with core's "updating local dependencies is not
supported" error.

Dependency edits deliberately do not run codegen. Users call `generate` when
they want generated SDK files refreshed.

## Deleted

The old `helpers/workspace-module-source` helper is removed. It contained the
operation-specific commands and the `/ws` workspace mount workaround.

The public `workspaceModuleSource` and `workspaceModuleSourceInclude` wrappers
are removed too. The former could only be implemented with the broken
module-side `Directory.asModuleSource(...)` call until Dang can rehydrate
helper-produced `ModuleSourceID` values. The latter was debug-only
introspection that exposed implementation details on the root API.

## Removal Path

When Dang can pass `*ID` scalar values to `load*FromID`, delete
`helpers/dagger-query` and the query files. Dang can then do the rehydration and
follow-up calls natively.

When module-side `moduleSource(...)` and `Directory.asModuleSource(...)` preserve
caller context correctly, delete the source-ID helpers too.

If core dependency mutation APIs are fixed first, prefer those APIs instead of
the mock-workspace update workaround.

## Verification

Helper builds:

```sh
cd helpers/module-source && go test ./...
cd helpers/directory-as-module-source && go test ./...
cd helpers/dagger-query && go test ./...
cd helpers/render-template && go test ./...
```

Function surface:

```sh
dagger functions --progress=plain
```

Init generation smoke, from a git-initialized empty repo:

```sh
dagger -m /path/to/go-sdk call init --name foo added-paths
dagger -m /path/to/go-sdk call init --name foo --path ./foo/bar added-paths
```

Local dependency add/remove smoke:

```sh
dagger -m /path/to/go-sdk call mod --path app deps add --source ../lib --name lib modified-paths
dagger -m /path/to/go-sdk call mod --path app deps remove --name lib modified-paths
```

Dependency update smoke:

```sh
dagger -m /path/to/go-sdk call mod --path app deps update modified-paths
```

Named local dependency update should still fail with core's unsupported-local
message:

```sh
dagger -m /path/to/go-sdk call mod --path app deps update --name lib modified-paths
```
